This directory contains copies of the Second Life standard internal
animations, all of which can be downloaded from:

The animations here are unmodified copies of these and are included
here purely to make the build process self-contained.

The file SL_Avatar_Tpose.bvh, with the "T pose", is supplied with the
Second Life standard avatar mesh, which you can download from:
