This directory is used to build Blobby Man animation scripts from
chat transcripts captured with the "Animation compile" command.  The
complete transcript (any unrelated chat traffic is automatically
ignored: it need not be deleted) is placed in a .chat file.  This
is then processed with the ../../tools/chat_to_anim_script.pl program,
which writes one or more LSL script files with names based upon the
animation name from the chat transcript (with any "BVH: " prefix
elided).

Since an individual script file cannot exceed 64 Kb of script memory,
long animations are automatically broken into multiple segments with
names like:
    Golf_Swing-1_3.lsl
    Golf_Swing-2_3.lsl
    Golf_Swing-3_3.lsl
When these are imported into Second Life and placed in the inventory
of the Blobby Man, they are usually given names like:
    Animation: Golf Swing 1/3
etc.  You must include the "Animation: " prefix in order for the
compiled animation to be recognised by the "Animation run" command.
You can then play the animation with:
    /1721 Animation play Golf Swing
