Files in this directory are edited extracts from the CMU motion
capture archive.  They start with the numbered segment given in
the name, but have usually been extracted from a larger capture,
edited in various ways with bvhacker, and sometimes post-processed
with various tools to adjust orientation, movement, and optimise
for looping.

The files in this directory use the original CMU skeleton structure
and channel assignments.  Transformation to the Second Life animation
format is performed when they are processed by CMUtoSL.pl.
